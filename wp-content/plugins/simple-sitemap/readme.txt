HTML sitemap to display content as a single linked list of posts and pages, or as groups sorted by taxonomy (via a drop-down box).

== Description ==

Note: From version 1.52 you can add the [simple-sitemap] shortcode to a Text widget too! Rendering of the sitemap is now one column so it fits nicely on posts, pages, or your sidebar.

This is probably the easiest way to add a powerful HTML sitemap to your site!

Unique and intuitive way to display your website content by simply adding a single shortcode [simple-sitemap] to a post, page, or sidebar (via a Text widget). See the Plugin screenshots for examples.

The order and style in which your blog posts and pages are displayed on the screen depends on the drop-down box option chosen. Post/pages are rendered as a single linked list of titles, or they can be grouped by date, author, category, and tag (each heading acts as a link the the relevant taxonomy type as well).

This gives your visitors an efficient way to view ALL site content in ONE place. It is also great for SEO purposes and makes it easier for spiders to index your site.

Available sorting options for pages are:

* Title
* Date
* Author

and for posts:

* Title
* Date
* Author
* Category
* Tag

To display the shortcode on a page, or post (though I recommended you add it to a page) just add the shortcode [simple-sitemap]. Then, simply publish the page and you will now have a sitemap enabled on your website.
